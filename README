Project: Heartbeat Classification with Spectral Roll-Off
Purpose: This project aims to classify heartbeats as normal or abnormal based on audio recordings. The code focuses on extracting spectral roll-off features from the audio data as a preprocessing step for subsequent classification models (not included in this code).
Data: The code assumes the availability of audio files in WAV format, organized into separate directories for normal and abnormal heartbeats.
Code Overview:
•	Imports: Imports necessary libraries for audio processing, data manipulation, and visualization.
•	Data Loading: Loads abnormal heart audio files from a specified directory.
•	Noise Injection and Rolloff Calculation:
o	Adds random noise to each audio file to simulate real-world conditions.
o	Calculates the spectral rolloff for each noisy audio segment using librosa.feature.spectral_rolloff.
o	Calculates the mean spectral rolloff for each audio file.
•	Dataframe Creation: Creates pandas DataFrames to store the spectral rolloff values and noisy audio data.
Dependencies:
•	librosa
•	numpy
•	pandas
•	glob
•	scipy.io.wavfile
Usage:
1.	Install the required dependencies using pip install librosa numpy pandas glob scipy.
2.	Place your audio files in separate directories for normal and abnormal heartbeats.
3.	Adjust the data_dir1 variable to point to the directory containing abnormal heart data.
4.	Run the code to process the audio files and calculate spectral rolloff features.
Limitations:
•	This code only processes abnormal heart data. Additional code is needed to handle normal heart data.
•	Noise injection is a simplified approach to simulating real-world conditions. More complex noise models might be considered.
•	The code does not include classification models. Further development is required to build a complete classification system.

Future Work:
•	Incorporate normal heart data processing.
•	Explore different noise models for more realistic simulations.
•	Implement classification models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, etc.) using the extracted features.
•	Evaluate the performance of the classification system using appropriate metrics.
